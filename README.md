# Sprite Animator
An added window view in Unity's editor for a better experience for editing Unity animations. Designed with pixel art specifically in mind.

vs Unity's default dope sheet. Pretty uninspiring to work with if you ask me.

- Copy and paste, duplicate, insert, and delete are supported on the custom timeline.
- Space bar control.
- Custom color background. Optional checkerboard pattern.
- Preview speeds.
- Preview zoom.

# Installation
SpriteAnimator is one script and can be placed in any Editor folder or it can be installed as a package with this repository. Once installed, to access, select Window in the Editor and Sprite Animator will be there. Choose any Unity animation file to get to work.

# Additional notes
While it is traditional for the creator to magnanimously accept the blame for whatever deficiencies remain. I don’t. Any errors, deficiencies, or problems in this package are somebody else’s fault, but I would appreciate knowing about them so as to determine who is to blame.

I've since moved on from Unity (I believe everyone should) but I wanted to post this in case it helps anyone in any way. The last version this was tested and developed with was Unity 2021.3.0f1. It's possible Unity has broken something in older builds.
